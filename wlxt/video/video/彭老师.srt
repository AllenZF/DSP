00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:12,886
Good morning everyone

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,197
Today I will discuss the Discrete Fourier Transform

3
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:26,170
You know in the time domain and the frequency domain

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,707
we learn a lot of different type of following transforms

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,090
First of all is Continue aperiodical signal

6
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,902
in the time domain

7
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,165
and the following transform

8
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:49,017
in the frequency domain is also Continue aperiodical

9
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:54,554
Ok that is the continue signals Fourier Transform

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,668
in the time domain and the frequency domain

11
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:02,823
This is the first Fourier Transform

12
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:09,985
we learn in the signals and systems before this course

13
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:18,153
And if the signal in the time domain is periodical

14
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:24,757
the signal in the time domain is periodical

15
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,025
what happen will in the frequency domain

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,785
It will be discrete spectrum

17
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,814
Think it about

18
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:42,647
Why

19
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,574
Why periodical signal in the time domain

20
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:51,115
the Fourier Transform is discrete spectrum

21
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,194
We call it line-spectrum

22
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,314
Why

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,455
Just a moment

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,890
If the signal in the time domain is discrete

25
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:35,995
what happen will in the frequency domain

26
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,961
It¡¯s periodical spectrum

27
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:46,676
You can see this two

28
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:50,974
if in the time domain the signal is periodical

29
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,844
the spectrum will be discrete

30
00:02:55,646 --> 00:03:00,574
And if in the time domain the signal is discrete

31
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:04,414
the spectrum will be periodical

32
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:15,464
And if the signal in the time domain

33
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:19,020
is discrete and periodical

34
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:22,068
discrete and periodical

35
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:25,410
what happen will in the frequency domain

36
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:32,348
The spectrum will be periodical and discrete

37
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:38,078
You can see both in time domain

38
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,673
and in frequency domain the signal

39
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:44,208
is discrete and periodical

40
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,895
So you can see

41
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:51,269
we have four different types of Fourier Transform

42
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:58,928
Why we need the last one-DFT

43
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:03,368
The DTFT is Discrete Time Fourier Transform

44
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:08,315
And DFT is Discrete Fourier Transform

45
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,937
What¡¯s the difference between the last two

46
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:19,047
The DTFT Discrete Time Fourier Transform

47
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:21,709
And DFT Discrete Fourier Transform

48
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,029
What¡¯s the difference

49
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:40,980
Typical DFT Pair ¦ÄT(t) is a ¦Ä train

50
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:48,457
a lot of equal distance

51
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,738
discrete in both

52
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:56,442
The period is capital T

53
00:04:56,954 --> 00:05:00,972
And the spectrum is ¦Ä¦Ø0

54
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:04,162
You can see both side

55
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:06,783
in the time domain ¦ÄT(t)

56
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:11,639
and in the frequency domain ¦Ä¦Ø0

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,190
we see

58
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,750
with the DFT  is 

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,546
both side discrete and periodical

60
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,152
and the period is capital T

61
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:32,762
And in the frequency domain

62
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:36,795
what about the period

63
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,675
¦Ø0

64
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:55,468
And what¡¯s the relationship between capital T and ¦Øo

65
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:57,794
Yeah that¡¯s good

66
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:00,862
You can see

67
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,682
¦Ø0 = 2¦Ğ/T

68
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:21,708
here

69
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:22,904
of course

70
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:26,013
this is discrete and periodical

71
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,146
the period is capital T

72
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:29,365
And here

73
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:32,439
the frequency domain of course is

74
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,564
discrete and periodical

75
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:39,961
the period is ¦Ø0

76
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,494
So this is a typical DFT pair

77
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:54,692
In DFT the signals in both sides are discrete

78
00:06:56,663 --> 00:07:00,554
so it is the only transform pair

79
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:06,131
which can be processed by computer

80
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,026
Why we need DFT

81
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:14,746
Just because we want to use 

82
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,600
computer to process the signals

83
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,287
And you know

84
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,440
within a digital computer

85
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:26,068
there are only zero and one in the computer

86
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,231
nothing else

87
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,333
Of course

88
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:33,992
a lot of tremendous number of zero and one in a computer

89
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:38,004
So all of the signals if you want to process

90
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,479
it must be discrete

91
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:43,145
That¡¯s right

92
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,571
And both sides must be discrete

93
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:50,238
So that¡¯s why we need DFT

94
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:51,813
Just because

95
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,225
both sides

96
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:55,775
in the time domain and the frequency domain

97
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,573
are discrete

98
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:02,226
So we can use computer to process it

99
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:08,311
The signals in both sides are periodical

100
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:15,097
so the processing could be in one period

101
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,621
Why

102
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,841
Just because it¡¯s periodical

103
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,218
What does it mean periodical

104
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:25,855
That mean in each period

105
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:29,553
all of the signal is exactly the same

106
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:30,193
That's Right

107
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,769
Just repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat

108
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:39,691
So we can only process one period

109
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:43,724
It¡¯s enough because all period is the same

110
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:53,537
So that means the number of calculation is limited

111
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,397
Just one period

112
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,151
so the calculation number is limited

113
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:06,327
And which is necessary for computer

114
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:09,852
Of course  it¡¯s necessary for computer

115
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:15,115
Computer maybe very very fast

116
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:19,036
means can process a lot of signals in one period

117
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:19,891
Ok

118
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:25,309
But the number must be limited

119
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:28,926
But for the period signal

120
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,195
in one period

121
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,152
the number is limited

122
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,366
so that is necessary to

123
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:39,206
use a computer to process the signals

124
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:48,441
And all of the signal information

125
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:53,317
could be kept in one period

126
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,395
All of the information

127
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,837
keep in one period

128
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:58,559
That¡¯s right

129
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:01,918
That¡¯s right

130
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,112
Of course yes

131
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:05,097
Why

132
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:09,577
Just because it¡¯s period

133
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:13,915
Each all of period is exactly the same

134
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:18,791
So one period keeps all of the signal information

135
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:19,749
Ok

136
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:29,285
So so which is necessary for accurate processing

137
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,156
You can accurate process because

138
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,762
if you want to process another period

139
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,779
you can not get anymore information

140
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:44,046
Because Each all of period

141
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:47,358
is exactly the same information

142
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,382
So this is why we need DFT 

143
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:58,603
and DFT is the only Fourier Transform

144
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,404
can use computer to process

145
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,277
The example is the natural signal

146
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:14,503
Almost all of the natural signals are continue

147
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:15,621
That¡¯s right

148
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,171
Natural signal

149
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:24,469
almost all of the signals are continue

150
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:26,216
analog signals

151
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:27,415
But now

152
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:32,759
just because we want to process signal with computer

153
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,295
we have to change the continue signal into the discrete

154
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:39,624
Ok

155
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:47,804
So the title is to make a signal discrete and periodical

156
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,628
Pay attention here

157
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,520
make  we have to make the continue signal

158
00:11:56,703 --> 00:12:00,888
into discrete and periodical

159
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,402
We have to do it 

160
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,253
because the computer can

161
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:07,844
process only discrete

162
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,779
just both sides are discrete

163
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,847
so both sides are periodical

164
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:17,068
First of all

165
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:20,522
we would like to have both sides are discrete

166
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,762
and then

167
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,048
just because both sides are discrete

168
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:32,306
so both sides must be periodical

169
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,523
And the period is just the same

170
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,656
In the natural signals

171
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:46,467
almost all of the natural signals are continue

172
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:51,282
so we need to make the signal discrete first

173
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:55,498
And then we can use computer to process it

174
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,591
The problem is how

175
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,764
How make the natural signals into discrete

176
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:11,532
The engineering signals are often continue

177
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:15,060
I say almost all of the signals in engineering

178
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:19,725
that means the natural signals are continue and periodical

179
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:26,092
So if we want to process the signals with DFT

180
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,285
Discrete Fourier Transform

181
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,585
both sides are discrete and periodical

182
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:37,527
We have to make the signals discrete and periodical

183
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,783
make the natural continuous and

184
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:48,547
periodical signal into a discrete and periodical signal

185
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,238
How

186
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:59,947
Sampling to make the signal discrete

187
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:05,089
And make the signal periodical

188
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:05,922
How

189
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,089
How make the signal periodical

190
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:24,006
If x[n] is a limited length

191
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:30,223
limited length that means only limited number in samples

192
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:37,202
that means a limited length N-point sequence

193
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:46,620
see it as one period of a periodical signal

194
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:52,319
see the limited length signal as one period

195
00:14:52,847 --> 00:15:00,131
and see it as just one period of a periodical signal

196
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,647
that means extend it to a periodical

197
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:09,548
One is limited number

198
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:14,171
we see the limited number signal as one period

199
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,819
and extend it to periodical

200
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:18,515
Ok

201
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,015
It¡¯s easy

202
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:20,794
very easy

203
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,052
So first of all

204
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:27,552
if this is a limited number signal

205
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:30,478
extend it to periodical

206
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,613
Just see the limited number signal

207
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:39,997
as one period of a periodical signal

208
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:44,253
But if x[n] is not limited

209
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:51,272
if x[n] is an infinite length sequence

210
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:56,705
cut off the tails

211
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,796
cut off the tails

212
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:04,225
make it limited

213
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:04,804
ok

214
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,047
It¡¯s easy

215
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,825
cut off the tails

216
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:11,684
both sides

217
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:18,359
make it limited and then what

218
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,926
Cut off the tails first

219
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:24,370
and then

220
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:32,378
see this limited number signal

221
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:38,074
as one period of a periodical sequence

222
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:38,849
That¡¯s right

223
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:42,796
Go back to limited number

224
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:47,692
so in this way we make

225
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:52,893
an aperiodical signal into a periodical

226
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:57,153
Of course you can say no

227
00:16:57,153 --> 00:17:01,460
cut off the tails will introduce what

228
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:02,984
Error

229
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,554
Of course introduce error

230
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,033
In the engineering

231
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:11,040
we always make such mistakes

232
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,428
You here

233
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:17,592
everybody will be an engineer

234
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:21,503
You know we always make such mistakes

235
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,490
Introduce error

236
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,055
we have to

237
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,482
Why

238
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,480
we have to

239
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,435
Why

240
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:39,667
Because we want to use computer to process it

241
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,893
Because we are lazy

242
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,089
that¡¯s right

243
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:52,134
You know the people how to make innovation

244
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,669
just because people are lazy

245
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:01,317
They invent all of the new things

246
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:05,066
just because we are lazy

247
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:11,181
So just because we want to process signals with computer

248
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:17,774
so we have to make the signal discrete and periodical

249
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:25,210
But original signal is continue and aperiodical

250
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:34,079
but we make it discrete and periodical

251
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,889
Of course we will introduce error

252
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:41,150
But we have to do it

253
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,537
We have to stay with it

254
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:44,939
Ok

255
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,633
So here

256
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,314
you can see

257
00:18:52,498 --> 00:19:02,097
we must develop truncation algorithm to reduce the error

258
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,362
which is windowing

259
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,419
So you know

260
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:09,300
if you make the continue signal into discrete

261
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,183
of course

262
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,753
we introduce error

263
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:18,564
And you want to make an aperiodical signal into a periodical

264
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,592
we introduce a cut-off tails

265
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,227
So of course

266
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,066
we introduce error

267
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:28,540
The problem is how to reduce it

268
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,425
How to reduce error

269
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,666
No error is impossible

270
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:40,761
Of course  No error is impossible

271
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:47,182
The problem is how to make how to reduce the error

272
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:51,723
So we have windowing

273
00:19:51,977 --> 00:20:01,688
You will learn more about the windowing later

274
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,240
Ok

275
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,226
thank you
